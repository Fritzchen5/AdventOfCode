Register A: 52884621
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program: 2,4,1,3,7,5,4,7,0,3,1,5,5,5,3,0

2, 4: B = lowest 3 bits of A
1, 3: inverts last 2 bits of B
7, 5: C = A / 2^B = right shift A by B bits
4, 7: B = C xor B
0, 3: right shift A by 3 bits
1, 5: inverts third to last and last bit of B
5, 5: output last 3 bits of B

3, 0: jump to beginning if A != 0
